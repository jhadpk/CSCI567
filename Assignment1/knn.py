        In this function, features is simply training data which is a 2D list with float values.
        For example, if the data looks like the following: Student 1 with features age 25, grade 3.8 and labeled as 0,
        Student 2 with features age 22, grade 3.0 and labeled as 1, then the feature data would be
        [ [25.0, 3.8], [22.0,3.0] ] and the corresponding label would be [0,1]

        For KNN, the training process is just loading of training data. Thus, all you need to do in this function
        is create some local variable in KNN class to store this data so you can use the data in later process.

        data point, find the majority of labels for these neighbours as the predicted label for that testing data point (you can assume that k is always a odd number).
